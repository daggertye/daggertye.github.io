Hey everyone! 

This is my first blog post (so please be gentle). No one's probably gonna be reading this, but I plan to populate this blog with various concepts and interesting interactions that I happen across in my day-to-day life. Furthermore, I hope that this blog serves as a journal (of sorts) for my own personal growth and development. 

I would like to say a special thanks to the awesome folks over at [kiko new](https://github.com/aweekj/kiko-now) for providing the layout. Over the next couple of (insert unit of time here), I hope to populate this blog with posts on Machine Learning, Math, and Computer Science.
