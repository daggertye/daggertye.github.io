I finished the fourth chapter in Rudin's [*Real and Complex Analysis*](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/real-complex-analysis-rudin/M0070542341.html), which covered elementary Hilbert Space Theory. This was by far the least abstract chapter and I really appreciate the break from topological and metric spaces. However, there were many questions which, in the end, did revolve around these concepts, but proofs were more computation and "show it converges" proofs. My writeup can be found below:
