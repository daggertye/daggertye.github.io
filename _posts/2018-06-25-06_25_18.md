This chapter of Erdmann and Wildon's [*Introduction to Lie Algebras*](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781846280405) covers various techniques of ideals and homomorphisms for Lie Algebras. In particular, it covers the quotient algebra (like in linear algebra) and the resulting homomorphism theorems (again like in lie algebra). 

Overall, I'm enjoying the less abstract material (compared to analysis) due to the structure that the algebra gives. However, this can be a double edged sword. It's a lot of calculations, which makes many of the questions monotonous. Furthermore, for this book specifically, almost all exercises are necessary since future exercises build on the earlier ones. My full writeup is given below:
