This chapter covers the basics of harmonic analysis and introduces information like the Cauchy-Riemann equations. It serves as a teaser chapter and, as such, most of the questions are rather bashy calculations. As an overall examination, I will say that the bash in real analysis is much less then the bash in complex, a worrisome sign since I hate bashing.
