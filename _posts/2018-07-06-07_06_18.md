The 8th chapter of Rudin's [RC Analysis](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/real-complex-analysis-rudin/M0070542341.html) covers Cartesian product of sigma-algebras. 

This chapter was split roughly 60-40 between the calculus portion and the topology of the sigma-algebras. Overall, I enjoyed the definition of Fubini's Theorem with our generalized measure and the introduction to convolutions (which elicited memories from combinatorics and machine learning), although (again) the topology portions seemed unmotivated without taking a proper course. My notes and solutions (to odd questions) are found below:
