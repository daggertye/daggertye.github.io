I've covered the third chapter in Rudin's [*Real and Complex Analysis*](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/real-complex-analysis-rudin/M0070542341.html). I really enjoyed the throwback to Jensen's Theorem, but also appreciated how it was presented in a different (analysis) light. In terms of actual concepts, this section focused less on the theoretical topological introduction and more on metric spaces and various computations. This made it more fun to work with, as I didn't feel constrained by the specific properties of various definitions as in the previous sections. 

For this section and later sections, I plan on transcribing the major theorems before working on the questions. I've found that it helps give me a quick reference guide when I forget a specific theorem. I've retroactively updated the notes for chapter one and chapter two. My writeup for chapter three can be found below
