This semester I took graduate algebra (Math 6310) and decided to transcribe the notes (thanks to [Linus](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~ls823/) for the inspiration). They can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/pdfs/6310_notes.pdf). I enjoyed the process and will most likely be adding notes for all my future classes (that are "note"-able).
