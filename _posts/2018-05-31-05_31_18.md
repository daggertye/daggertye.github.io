I covered the second chapter of Rudin's [*Real and Complex Analysis*](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/real-complex-analysis-rudin/M0070542341.html). It's still pretty straightfoward, but some of the techniques used are getting tougher to keep up with. I might start taking notes over the theorems, since I'm finding myself struggling to recall everything, which greatly hampers the learning process. Here are my solutions to the odd questions, although some of them may not be well explained.
