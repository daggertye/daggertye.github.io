Today I covered lecture 8 in Berkeley's [deep rl course](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse-fa17/index.html). This covered model based planning, which optimizes a policy when the model is given. 

This was a lot of [ORIE](http://www.orie.cornell.edu/) stuff, which is relatively foreign to me. For example, unlike previous lectures which still had the applicable neural network, this chapter covered mathematical optimization methods which I'm still unfamiliar with. However, I have been looking into the mathematical programming courses offered by the ORIE graduate program, but at the current moment I don't think this is that applicable to me. However, I expect the next chapter, which covers model based reinforcement learning, to be more applicable to my current state.  

Below are my notes
