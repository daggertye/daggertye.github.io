Erdmann and Wildon's [*Introduction to Lie Algebras*](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781846280405) covers eigenvalues, weights, and the Invariance Lemma. 

Most of this information is inspired from Linear Algebra, and the topics of eigenvalues vs weights were rather confusing (in terms of a linear algebra background). However, the introduction of the Invariance Lemma (when applied to the broad range of Lie Algebras) was rather interesting. Below are my notes:
