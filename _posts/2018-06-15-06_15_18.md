I've started reading through Erdmann and Wildon's [*Introduction to Lie Algebras*](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781846280405) as a good introduction to Lie Algebras bereft of any mention of manifolds. The first chapter doesn't cover anything too complicated, just the basic definitions of Lie Algebras, so I'll be looking forward to more complicated chapters. My writeup can be found below:
