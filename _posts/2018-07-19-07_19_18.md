Rudin's [RC Analysis](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/real-complex-analysis-rudin/M0070542341.html) covers Fourier transforms in chapter 9. 

This chapter included a lot of integration techniques (differential equations and integration by parts), and was overall pretty cut and dry. Mostly, I'm interested in the application of Fourier transforms in Computer Vision, as seen in one of this year's ICML oral presentation covering [Spherical CNN's](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Hkbd5xZRb). The next chapter starts on complex analysis, so I will see if I'll continue to focus on this book.
