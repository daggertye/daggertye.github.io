This chapter of Erdmann and Wildon's [*Introduction to Lie Algebras*](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781846280405) covers the simplest Lie Algebras. 

In particular, Algebras such as the Heisenberg Algebra are derived using the dimension of derived algebras. Furthermore, the number of algebras per dimension one, two, and three are proved (up to isomorphism). As a result, a lot of linear algebra is used to derive the Lie Algebras for lower dimensions, which makes most of this chapter computationally menial. Anyways, here's my notes/problems:
