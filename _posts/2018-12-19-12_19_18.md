I'm Back!

After a stressful semester of real analysis, it's time again to cover complex analysis for 6120 next semester. Only ten(?) chapters remaining, but some of the later chapters focus more on functional stuff. Anyways, today I covered the basics of holomorphic functions. This includes the Cauchy Integral Thm and Residues. Most of the questions were relatively straightforward, and as usual I did the (approximately) the odd ones. My notes and solutions can be found below.
