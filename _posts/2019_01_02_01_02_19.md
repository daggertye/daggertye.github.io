We cover rational functions here. In particular, the book defines the Riemannian sphere (C + infinity) and is the 1-point compact superset of C. This helps us define compact sets for which we can approximate functions using rational functions. This was also a pretty paltry, but interesting, chapter; the next chapter covers for more abstract functions.
