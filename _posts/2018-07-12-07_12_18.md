Erdmann and Wildon's [*Introduction to Lie Algebras*](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781846280405) covers solvable and nilpotent algebras in chapter 4. 

While most of this information feels rather unmotivated and disjointed, looking forward reveals (at least partially) some motivation. In particular the introduction of simple and semisimple Lie Algebras will be of great use. Furthermore, the classification of all solvable Lie Algebras into general categories evokes thoughts about possible similar theorems in the future. Here are my notes and problems:
