This is the fifth chapter in my ongoing note-problem solving series of Rudin's [*Real and Complex Analysis*](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/real-complex-analysis-rudin/M0070542341.html). This chapter covers various problem solving "techniques" for banach spaces, which is (somewhat) similar to the previous chapter on Hilbert spaces. Needless to say, I'll be glad for the change of pace when I cover complex measures in the next chapter.
