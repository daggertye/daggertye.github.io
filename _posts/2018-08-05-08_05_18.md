Chapter 6 of Ermann and Wildon's [Lie Algebra Book](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781846280405) covers Lie's and Engel's Theorems. 

Overall, this was a pretty cut and dry chapter. Like the [previous chapter](../07_27_18/) it was really focused on enumerating similar theorems across Lie and Linear Algebra. The next chapter (which covers Representations) should be more fun and less plug and chug.
